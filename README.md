# complexnumbers
My first GitHub repository. I started learning C++ to get to learn more about low-level concepts of programming and tried to write a complex number arithmetic library. I tried to follow C++ Core Guidelines. Classes/Tests and more functionality will follow once I'm more familiar with the language.
